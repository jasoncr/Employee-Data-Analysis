# sql-challenge

In this challenge I took on the roll of a data engineer at a company. The company has their employees' information recorded in 6 differenct .csv files. As the data engineer I needed to find a way to link all these in an intelligent way. Therefore, I started out with an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to visualize what is in each csv and how each csv would be linked to the next. That ERD is below.
